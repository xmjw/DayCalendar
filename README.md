DayCalendar
===========

A simple 7-day calendar built on Rail to Demonstrate the feasibility of a startup idea.

Plan
----

The purpose of this Rail App (Which is MASSIVELY overkill) is to create a faily robust drag-to-create 7 day calendar. This data should then be stored in a database, and reloaded/updated using AJAX.

The idea is to replace the terrible time reporting systems I have been forced to use over the years with something simple, fast, and elegant.

Roadmap
-------

* Simple Calendar (Done)
* Simple Drag-To-Create (Done)
* Overlay Drag-To-Create
* Delete
* Add details to Entry
* Store deatils in DB
* Load Details on return
* Turn it into some sort of startup...
